# TCCAgrimensor
Repository for my college graduation work: An android app which capture gps coordinates, create a polygon, shows its perimeter and area values in meters and draw it in google maps. Almost everything there is in brazillian portuguese (my first language).

  App-release.apk is the instalation file for your phone. This app should work with any smartphone running Android 4.2.2.
  
 	TCC agrimensor.pdf is the graduation paper.
  
  The "main" folder contains the source code for the app, it is part of the android studio project folder.
